## Quick start
- Make an overleaf and instantly access the template read to edit and compile straight in your browser. [Click here to get started straightaway][1], you can even import the github directly into your overleaf project.

## Compiling the `.tex` files
- You will need to have the `preamble.tex` file in the same folder as the `.tex` file you wish to compile. Then compile with lualatex to get the nice mozilla fira sans fonts. But pdftex should work fine as well.
