# kesmaths-beamer
The goal is to convert all of Dr. Rackham's *amazing* powerpoints into glorious LaTeX beamer presentations. The powerpoints exist for virtually every secondary school maths topic, but are sadly all in powerpoint...

## Getting Started
- Join the [discord][1], then you can post your github username and be added as a contributor. Then you can select a topic and someone will send you the `.pptx` which you can then start converting to `.tex` :)
- Edit whatever you want on the github (especially if you see any mistakes etc.), just make sure to update the `status.csv` file.
- Feel free to change the `status.csv` file, by adding extra columns, removing ones, etc.
- When you start a new powerpoint make sure to add it to the `status.csv` file
- Make an overleaf and instantly access the template read to edit and compile straight in your browser. [Click here to get started straightaway][2], you can even import the github directly into your overleaf project.

## Compiling the `.tex` files without overleaf
- You will need to have the `preamble.tex` file in the same folder as the `.tex` file you wish to compile. Then compile with lualatex to get the nice mozilla fira sans fonts. But pdftex should work fine as well.

## Progress
- [ ] Total, so far 17 out of god knows how many
- [ ] FurtherDiscrete, so far 11/13
- [ ] FurtherPure-ComplexNumbers, so far 3/8
- [ ] FurtherPure-DifferentialEquations, so far 1/3
- [ ] FurtherPure-FurtherCalculus, so far 2/6

There are many more topics, just add them as you go along...
